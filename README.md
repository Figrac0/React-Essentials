# React Essentials  

### A learning project built to demonstrate and practice the core React concepts.  

---

## Description  

This application was created as a **hands-on guide** to explore the fundamentals of React.  
It covers the essential building blocks you need to start working with the library:  

- **Components** — building reusable UI elements  
- **JSX** — JavaScript syntax extension for writing UI markup  
- **Props** — passing input data into components for configuration and reuse  
- **State** — managing dynamic data and re-rendering UI when it changes  

---

## Project Structure  

- `src/components` — reusable components (`Header`, `CoreConcept`, `TabButton`)  
- `src/data.js` — static data and examples displayed in the app  
- `src/App.js` — main application component

## Purpose

The project is designed as an educational example.
Its main goal is to provide a clear, practical demonstration of how React's core concepts work
and how they can be applied in real-world applications.
